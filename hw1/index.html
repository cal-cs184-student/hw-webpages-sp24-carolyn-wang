    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p><i>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole.
        Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</i></p>
    <p>In this homework, I implemented various rasterization techniques, explored pixel sampling methods for texture
      mapping, and used barycentric coordinates for color interpolation within triangles.
      One part of this that I found particularly enjoyable was building up from
      basic shape rasterization to sophisticated texture mapping with antialiasing. There are many ways that sampling
      and averaging between points to create a smooth effect can enhance the overall viewing experience for computer
      graphics.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
    <p><i>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.
      </i></p>
    <p>First, I calculated the bounding box by determining the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the triangle.
      Then, for each pixel within this bounding box, I check if the pixel’s offset center is inside the triangle using
      the point-in-triangle test (cross product method. If the pixel's center is determined to be inside the triangle or
      on its boundary, I call `fill_pixel()` to fill in the pixel with the specified color.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the
        triangle. </i></p>
    <p>Because my algorithm iterates through each pixel of the bounding box exactly one time, it will never perform
      worse than an algorithm that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

    <p><i>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications
        did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your
        triangles.</i></p>
    <p>Supersampling is useful because it performs antialiasing by rendering the image at higher resolutions then
      downsampling.
      <br>To build the supersampling algorithm, I first created a higher resolution frame buffer to store the color
      values of the supersampled pixels. For every pixel in the original frame buffer, I created sample_rate ^ 2 more
      pixels fitting into the same space.
      <br>hen, I modified the set_sample_rate method to set the sample rate and resizes the sample_buffer to hold all
      supersamples.
      <br>Finally for rasterizing triangles, my function calculates the bounding box of a triangle and iterates over
      each pixel within it. For each pixel, it iterates over each supersample and repeats the same process from task 1
      to determine if the sample is inside the triangle. If sample is inside, its color is set in the sample_buffer.
      After all elements are rasterized, this function averages the colors of the supersamples for each pixel, converts
      them to 8-bit color values, and then stores them in the final rgb_framebuffer_target. This color averaging process
      is what antialias the triangle, while achieving higher resolution.

        Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to
        compare them side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for
        example, a very skinny triangle corner. Explain why these results are observed.</i></p>
    <p>For the very skinny triangle corners, lower sample rates will undersample the color and leave sparse corners. By
      increasing the sample rate then producing an averaged color, the triangles for higher sample rates will have more
      accurate yet slightly blurred corners. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
    <p><i>Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is
        to use a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should
        produce a smoothly blended color triangle.</i></p>

    <p>The barycentric coordinates are a way to describe any point within a triangle as a weighted average of the
      triangle's vertices. The color at each pixel is calculated pasted on the areas of subtriangles formed by the point
      and the vertices of the main triangle. More specifically, the the interpolation formula color = alpha * c0 + beta
      * c1 + gamma * c2 blends the vertex colors based on the point's position within the triangle.
      <br>In the image below, the method produces a smoothly blended triangle with one purple, one pink, and one orange
      vertex.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

    <p><i>Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping.
        Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear.</i></p>

    <p>Pixel sampling is used to map textures and designs onto 3D model. Since a one-to-one mapping of isn’t possible
      between the texel and screen area (due to difference in resolution and perspective), pixel sampling is necessary
      to decide which texels from a texture image contribute to the color of a specific pixel on the rendered image.
      <br>To implement pixel sampling for texture mapping, I first determine which part of the texture corresponds to a
      screen pixel. Then, I used a sampling method to transfer the color from the texture.
      <br>The first sampling method is Nearest Neighbor Sampling. The algorithm looks at the texture coordinates
      corresponding to each pixel and selects the color of the nearest texel. This approach is simple but produces lower
      quality images since it doesn’t take into account the colors of surrounding texels.
      <br>The second sampling method is Bilinear filtering. Rather than selecting the nearest texel's color, bilinear
      filtering calculates color from the weighted average of the four nearest texels to the pixel's corresponding
      texture coordinates. The final color is a blend smoothly transitions between texels.
    </p>

    <p><i>Check out the svg files in the svg/texmap/ directory. Use the pixel inspector to find a good example of where
        bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling. Show and compare four png screenshots using nearest sampling
        at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and
        bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.</i></p>
    <p><i>Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between the two methods and
        why.</i></p>

    <p>Nearest Sampling; Sample Rate 1</p>
    <img src="./images/task5_nearpixel_1.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
    <p>Nearest Sampling; Sample Rate 16</p>
    <img src="./images/task5_nearpixel_16.png" align="middle" width="90%" />

    <p>Bilinear Sampling; Sample Rate 1</p>
    <img src="./images/task5_bilinear_1.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
    <p>Bilinear Sampling; Sample Rate 16</p>
    <img src="./images/task5_bilinear_16.png" align="middle" width="90%" />
    <hr>

    <p>Bilinear sampling performs better than nearest sampling because it calculates the output pixel value using linear
      interpolation between the four nearest pixels, resulting in a smoother transition between colors and textures. On
      the other hand, nearest neighbor sampling only selects the color of the closest pixel. This can lead to abrupt
      changes in color and result in a more pixelated image, especially when there is extreme change in angle or
      perspective like the examples above. </p>
    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
    <p><i>Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it for texture mapping.</i></p>
    <p>Level sampling is a texture mapping method that selects the appropriate amount of detail based on the distance of
      the surface from the viewer
      <br>To implement this, I first generate progressively downsampeld mipmaps from the original high resolution
      texture. During rendering, I calculate level of detail based on the distance of the textured object from the
      camera by calculating the ratio of texture pixels (texels) to screen pixels and selecting the mipmap level that
      most closely matches this ratio.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><i>You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of
        samples per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three
        various techniques.</i></p>
    <p>1. Nearest Pixel Sampling
      <br>Fast speed since you only need to select the nearest pixel
      <br>Low memory usage
      <br>Poor antialiasing ability
      <br>
      <br>2. Mipmap:
      <br>Moderate speed since method needs to select the appropriate mipmap level
      <br>High memory usage since we need to store multiple versions of the texture at different resolutions.
      <br>Reduces aliasing and provides smoother transitions
      <br>

      <br>3. Supersampling:
      <br>Slowest speed since method needs sample multiple times per pixel and then averaging the results
      <br>Highest memory usage since it needs to render the image at several times the original resolution before
      downsampling
      <br>Very good antialiasing results since averaging multiple samples per edges smooths edges and textures.
